# SPL-Management-System
Project Description:
SPL Management System is a web based application which will help the Institution of Information Technology at DU to manage its Software Project lab (SPL). This application will help the SPL committee to assign supervisors in SPL-1, SPL-2, SPL-3.  It will help the SPL course evaluators in evaluation of both continuous and final marks. 

Scope of the Project:
This project has these following features:
Account: There are four types of accounts. These are:
Admin account
Student account
Supervisor account
Co-ordinator account
Admin  will monitor this application and authenticate the users. Supervisor and co-ordinator also the admin of this application. Users will create an account, log-in into their account and  the Password recovery option will be available.

Supervisor Assigning:
SPL-1: Supervisor will be assigned randomly by matching their interest with the teachers.
SPL-2: Students will form a team, then they’ll select a supervisor willingly. Rest of the students who can’t manage the supervisor (as one supervisor can take only one team) will share their ideas and the system will match the ideas with teachers' interest by maintaining hierarchy. Then a supervisor will be assigned for those teams.
SPL-3: Supervisor will be allocated automatically for those students who can’t manage supervisor.This allocation will be through checking whether teachers and students' interest get matched or not.

After allocating supervisor,teachers will be able to post any notice for students and he/she can submit marks through this application.


The project can be extended for further develeopment and many more scope to add new features in SPL Management System.
